# Hello, I’m Brandon Alanes

**Data Analyst | U.S. Army Reserve | Information Systems Major**

I’m a data analyst skilled in Python, SQL, and cloud-based analytics who enjoys transforming
complex data into clear, actionable insights. My background as a U.S. Army Reserve Sergeant 
and Amazon associate has strengthened my communication, leadership, and collaboration 
skills—allowing me to bridge the gap between technical analysis and business understanding. 
I’m passionate about using data to drive smarter decisions and operational efficiency.

 My portfolio includes:

* **E-commerce analysis:** Identifying the real ROI of discounts on shopper behavior.
* **Google Merchandise Store analytics:** Analyzing product themes and performance in Tableau.
* **Personal finance tracker:** SQL + Python project designed to automate savings insights.

 I’m gaining hands-on experience with:

* **SQL** (data extraction & transformation)
* **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)**
* **Cloud platforms (Google Cloud, AWS basics)**
* **Data visualization (Tableau, Power BI)**

 **Let’s connect!**
