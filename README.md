- Hello, Iâ€™m Brandon Alanes
-  I'm a Data Analyst(aspiring) working towards a career in Data Analytics. I'm currently serving in the U.S. Army Reserves which
-  has been a great help in paying for my bachelor's degree in Information Systems. I currently hold the CompTIA Data+ and Cloud+
-  certifications, and am currently studying to take the Microsoft Data Analyst Associate(PL-300) certification exam while doing
-  analyst projects in my free time. I have some substantial hands on experience working with SQL and Python from my personal projects
- as well as some light experience working with GCP for my capstone project for my BSIS and for personal projects while studying for
- the CompTIA Cloud+ exam.
